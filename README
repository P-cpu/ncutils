This package contains the sources and a binary version of NCCodecs. The
binary version contains native libraries compiled for Linux x86 and 
Linux x86_64.

To verify if native acceleration is available for your system you can
run:

java -cp NCUtilsCodec.jar ch.epfl.arni.ncutils.CodecFactory

To rebuild the sources use Ant (tested with version 1.8.2). To build the
native libraries make, gcc (both for x86 and x86_64) and javah must be 
installed. You might need to change the paths in src/jni/Makefile to work
with your environment.

The directory examples contains two examples, one uses the high level
Java API and one uses the low level C API.
